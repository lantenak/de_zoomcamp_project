# What is it about?

This project explores protected areas' types and years of enactment of that status based on The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA).

# What questions is this project trying to answer?

Keeping in mind that expression 'protected areas' more or less on hearing, it would be interesing to know:
1. What are the most common protected areas' types?

Here in project protected areas with explicitly defined year of status are only viewed, so this question can be answered too:  
2. What dynamics of such statuses enactment per decades?

# How to run it?
